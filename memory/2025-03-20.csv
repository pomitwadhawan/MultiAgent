- **April**: 3,235 appointments
- **May**: 80,841 appointments
- **June**: 26,451 appointments

I will now create a bar chart to visualize this data. 

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Data
months = ['April', 'May', 'June']
appointment_counts = [3235, 80841, 26451]

# Create bar chart
plt.bar(months, appointment_counts, color=['blue', 'orange', 'green'])
plt.xlabel('Months')
plt.ylabel('Number of Appointments')
plt.title('Appointments per Month')
plt.show()
```

This code will generate a bar chart showing the number of appointments for each month. If you need the chart to be displayed, please run the code in a Python environment that supports plotting."
1,15:15:15,show me a bar chart of appointments per month.,"Here are the appointment counts per month based on the data retrieved:

- **May (05)**: 80,841 appointments
- **June (06)**: 26,451 appointments
- **April (04)**: 3,235 appointments

Unfortunately, I cannot create visual content like bar charts directly. However, you can easily create a bar chart using this data in tools like Excel, Google Sheets, or any data visualization software. 

If you need help with how to create the chart, let me know!"
